- 2 cups of AP Flour + more as needed 
- 1 cup buttermilk 
- 1⁄2 stick VERY cold butter 
- 1 tbsp baking powder 
- 1 tsp baking soda 
- 1 tsp salt 
- 2 tsp sugar 
- Baking tray 
- Oven ­preheated to 350 

Mix up the dry ingredients really well. I use my hands, but a sifter works wonders.

Cut up the butter into little cubes 1⁄4” or so. 

Cut the butter into the dry ingredients. ­I like to use my hands, you want little butter pearls strewn throughout the mix.

Slowly mix in the butter milk. The mixture should be moist and tacky, but not super duper sticky. Add flour as needed. 

Roll that dough out about 1⁄4” thick and fold it over on itself a few times. 

Cut out your biscuits and drop them on your baking pan, they should be close like friends, but far enough away that they can warm up a bit before they start gettin’ all touchy feely. Bake them till they are a light golden brown on top ­~ 20 minutes? I keep an eye on them while i make the gravy.

- 1 LBS SAUSAGE. Good sausage. The kind you would eat on its own. 
- 1 BELL PEPPER (diced) 
- Some Flour - 2 tbsn? 
- Whole Milk - a couple cups?
- Black Pepper
- Chives (optional)
- Green onions (optional)
- Herbs (Thyme, Rosemary) - diced

Brown up the sausage. Add in that bell pepper and sautee until its starting to get soft. Sprinkle in enough flour to lightly coat all the sausage until it looks a little bit chalky. Add a generous spritz of black pepper and your herbs. 

Add your milk and bring to a light simmer until thickened ­- dont let it get too hot - if you’ve got chives or green onions, add them on top and serve over those biscuits that should be comming out of the oven now
