# Herman's Whisky Sours
**From Robâ€™s grandpa**

The following makes 3 drinks:

- 2 oz lemon juice - fresh
- 6 oz whiskey
- 5 tsp sugar - reg. spoon, not measuring spoon - (TODO: convert to tbsp)
- "touch" of cherry juice

Shake above ingredients, pour into blender, briefly blend along with:

1 egg white (maybe less; quite foamy)

Pour into glasses, add:

3 oz 7-Up (I like 3+; original recipe calls for a "splash")

Garnish with:

3 Orange slices
Cherry(ies)
