## Herman's Whiskey Sours
*From Robâ€™s Grandpa Herman*

The following makes 3 drinks:

- 2 oz lemon juice - fresh
- 6 oz whiskey
- 5 tsp sugar - reg. spoon, not measuring spoon - (TODO: convert to tbsp)
- "touch" of cherry juice
- 1 egg white (maybe less; quite foamy)
- 3 oz 7-Up (I like 3+; original recipe calls for a "splash")
- Orange slices
- Maraschino cherries

Shake together lemon juice, whiskey, sugar, cherry juice, pour in blender.

Blend briefly along with egg white to foam.

Pour into glasses, add 7-Up, garnish with Orange slices & cherries
